## Project Specification Document - Dotan Meir Website Redesign

**1. Project Goal:**

To redesign and develop the existing single-page landing page for Dotan Meir, a waterproofing consultant and building inspection expert, into a multi-page website. The primary focus of the new website will be on **waterproofing consultation** and **building inspection (בדק בית ומבנים)**. Content related to carpentry (נגרות אומן) and granite/marble coverings (חיפויי גרניט ושיש) will be removed.

**2. Target Audience:**

The target audience includes individuals and businesses in the construction and real estate industries seeking expert advice and services in waterproofing and building inspection. This may include homeowners, developers, contractors, property managers, and legal professionals involved in construction disputes.

**3. Website Structure (Information Architecture):**

The new website will consist of the following pages, as proposed:

- **Homepage:**
  - Logo and Hero section.
  - General introductory information about Dotan Meir and his expertise.
  - Highlight key services: Waterproofing Consultation and Building Inspection.
  - A carousel or section showcasing example projects related to waterproofing and building inspection.
  - Contact details and links to WhatsApp, email, and phone.
- **Solutions (פתרונות):**
  - Detailed information about the services offered.
  - **Waterproofing Consultation (ייעוץ איטום):**
    - Description of services, potentially including planning, project supervision, advanced sealing solutions for roofs and basements, injection sealing and structure rehabilitation.
    - Emphasis on using advanced technologies and proven application methods.
    - Mentioning expertise in identifying areas with inadequate or unsuitable waterproofing using advanced equipment.
    - Highlighting the importance of professional waterproofing in preventing water penetration and weather damage.
    - Reference to standards from the Standards Institution of Israel.
  - **Building and Structural Inspection (בדק בית ומבנים):**
    - Details about building inspection services, potentially including pre-purchase inspections of new and second-hand homes.
    - Expertise in identifying construction defects and providing solutions.
    - Mentioning the role in legal disputes as a waterproofing expert.
  - **Coating Consultation (ייעוץ ציפויים):**
    - Information about consultation services for floor coatings and steel structures. This should likely focus on the expertise related to waterproofing aspects of coatings rather than general decorative coatings, given the removal of other coating services.
- **Projects (פרוייקטים):**
  - A dedicated section showcasing completed projects related to waterproofing and building inspection.
  - Each project can have a brief description and potentially images.
  - Filtering or categorization of projects by type (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial, waterproofing, inspection) would be beneficial.
- **Articles (מאמרים):**
  - A page listing articles related to waterproofing, building inspection, and related topics.
  - Each article listing should include a preview (title, short excerpt, image).
  - Clicking on an article should lead to a dedicated page with the full content.
  - Content could discuss common waterproofing issues, the importance of building inspection, new technologies in the field, etc..
- **About (אודות):**
  - Detailed information about Dotan Meir's background, qualifications (certified waterproofing consultant, building inspection expert), experience, and expertise in the industry.
  - Potentially include a personal statement or company philosophy.
- **Contact Us (צור קשר):**
  - Contact form for inquiries.
  - Direct contact details: phone number, email address.
  - Links to WhatsApp, email, and phone for easy contact.
  - Potentially an address or service area information.

**4. Content Strategy:**

- All content will be focused on establishing Dotan Meir as a leading expert in **waterproofing consultation** and **building inspection**.
- Content should be informative, professional, and demonstrate expertise through detailed descriptions of services, project examples, and insightful articles.
- The language should be accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.
- Project descriptions should highlight the challenges, solutions provided, and positive outcomes, emphasizing the value of Dotan Meir's expertise.
- Articles should provide valuable information and establish Dotan Meir as a thought leader in the industry.

**5. Functionality:**

- Responsive design for optimal viewing on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Clear and intuitive navigation.
- Contact form with appropriate validation.
- Links to WhatsApp, email, and phone for easy communication.
- Potentially a search function for articles and projects.
- The articles section should support pagination or other methods for easy browsing of multiple articles.

**6. Technology Stack:**

- **Main Framework:** Astro [User provided].
- **Dynamic Components (if needed):** React [User provided].

- **Code Repository:** GitHub ([https://github.com/MeirJC/dotan-d.meyers-landing](https://github.com/MeirJC/dotan-d.meyers-landing)) [User provided].
- The existing project structure and configurations (e.g., `astro.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`) will likely serve as a starting point.
